# Women in Stack Overflow survey 2020

Analysis of some aspects of the female part in the Stack Overflow survey 2020.

## Motivation

Stack Overflow has been surveying its users and contributors yearly since 2011. Over the years, this questionnaire has
developed into a survey to understand the participants' interests in technologies or frameworks, but moreover, it seeks
to understand people's diversity in programming worldwide.

Thus, the Stack Overflow survey 2020 offers an excellent opportunity to figure out more about women in programming.

## Libraries

The libraries used for this work are:

- pandas==1.2.3
- matplotlib==3.3.4

## Files

The following files are provided in this repository:

- requirements.txt: for facilitated import of the required packages
- stackoverflow_survey_2020.ipynb: the code for analysis of the Stack Overflow data
- README_2020.txt: the official README file published by Stack Overflow with the explanation of their files.

- survey_results_public.csv: public results of the survey
- survey_results_schema.csv: schema relating the survey questions to the columns of the public data

## Summary

The female workforce in the programming community is a minority. Nevertheless, the women are a highly-educated and often
young workforce in various fields where programming is needed. The majority work as developers and are satisfied with
their jobs. A company culture with flex-time and exciting programming languages and frameworks are of high importance to
these women.
